SCL Interpreter:
Using the scanner, parser, and interpreter subprograms, the SCL language defined in the OurSCLGrammar.txt document can be used to create meaningful code files.
The SCL code files are interpreted immediately and the results are displayed to the console.

This project was created as part of the course CS 4308: Concepts of Programming Languages taught by Professor Sarah North during the Fall 2023 semester.
This group project was composed of the members Connor Bell, Dylan Carder, Sebastian Utz, and Kevin Vu with Dylan Carder leading development.
